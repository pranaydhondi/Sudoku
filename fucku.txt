----------------------------------------------------DESCRIPTION-----------------------------------------------------------
Description :-
 1) The sudoku game obtained by our efforts gives a sudoku (of random hardness)
 and asks to solve the problem .. At the same time a timer is also set so that they can check the 
time that they would take to solve the sudoku 
2)In taking output of numbers ,
a New frame is created and and the number that the user wants is to clicked and is submitted by using the button 
"OK"
3)The project whick we did also solves a  sudoku (which can be sovable) given by user,
in the case of sudoku which contains may solutions it gives one of them.
4)Graphics used by us is very low because this project needs very less grphics ..
Tries to apply graphics in main page and others....
-------------------------------------------------------------IDEA-------------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL IDEA:-
Procedure to solve sudoku:-

A) First of all the sudoku frame takes the input from random sudoku creater and leaves the empty spaces
B) the empty sudoku blanks take the list containg values from 1 to 9
C) Now as for solving the sudoku, we adopt the first method called CRME method(CRME stand for coloum row minigrid elimination)
D) In this method we remove the numbers present already in the row,coloum and minigrids,and this method is repeated untill we get same sudokus
E) If the sudoku is not solved by this method, we have a another method called LONERANGER method 
F) In this method we check for single numbers in whole mini grid , column and row and replace that list by that number 
G) If sudoku is changed we trying solving the obtained sudoku from first method .
H) Even after this some sudoku can't be solved .
I) so now we adopt another method called twins and Triplets
J) In this method we look for two lists containing same list of two numbers  called twins and three lists containing same list of three numbers or list which are subset of list of three numbers  called triplets
K)Using these twins and triplets we can eliminate the choices for filling the empty space 
L)BY then if sudoku changed we start from first ,Else we have another method called BruteForce Elimination.
M)In this method , we replace with the element of the list and carry on the process from first representing a loop.
N)If that element does not solve sudoku  we replace with the other and start the process once again.
 
Procedure to Create sudoku:-
1) we can create almost all possible  sudokus just from solution of one sudoku by swaping rows,columns in 3*9 and 9*3 boxes 
and transposing ,taking mirror images ,keeping blank spaces in sudoku according to the difficulty level .

-------------------------------------------------------BUGS---------------------------------------------------------------------
1)when we click the icon when sudoku is displayed ,
we can get as many sub-windows as possible by clicking the icon.
